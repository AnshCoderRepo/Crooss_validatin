Introduction
Cross-validation is a technique used in machine learning to assess the performance and generalization ability of a model. It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining data. This repository serves as a tutorial and resource hub for understanding and implementing various cross-validation strategies.
